# OBDS Changelog

## Release

**Version:** OBDS 1.0.1  
**Status:** Stable  
**Date:** 2026-08-27

## 1.0.1

**Licensing clarification. No normative contract change.**

Section 32 previously recommended CC BY 4.0 for the specification and documentation and
Apache License 2.0 for schemas, fixtures and reference software. That recommendation did not
match the licensing model under which OBDS is actually published, and it could be read as a
grant of unrestricted commercial use.

Changed in 1.0.1:

- section 32 is renamed from "How the open project is governed" to "How the project is governed";
- OBDS is described as a publicly available, vendor-neutral specification rather than an open standard;
- "reference tooling is open where practical" becomes "reference tooling is published together with the specification";
- the CC BY 4.0 and Apache License 2.0 recommendation is removed;
- a new section 32.1 states the actual use and licensing model: free use for personal,
  educational, academic, non-profit, testing, evaluation and non-production proof-of-concept work,
  including internal evaluation by a commercial organisation; a separate commercial licence for
  paid client work, agency services, consulting, production use, managed services, commercial
  products, commercial redistribution and the sale of OBDS-based deliverables;
- section 32.1 records that the licensing covers the published materials only, not the underlying
  ideas, principles or methods, and that trademarks are reserved separately;
- section 33 and the release artefacts are renamed from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1.

Not changed in 1.0.1:

- every normative contract;
- all 21 public schemas and all 6 public value schemas, byte for byte;
- every schema `$id`, which continues to resolve under `/schemas/1.0.0/` and
  `/value-schemas/1.0.0/`;
- `schemaVersion`, which remains `1.0.0` because the schema contract did not move;
- the reference implementation and the conformance suite, apart from the renamed file
  references they read.

The release gate enforces this: it recomputes a fingerprint over all 27 public contracts and
fails if it differs from the frozen 1.0.0 surface.

OBDS 1.0.0 remains published exactly as released.

## The 1.0 decision

OBDS has one normative specification, one required Foundation and optional capabilities. The separate CORE specification is retired.

> **One specification. One Foundation. Optional capabilities.**

## Changed from 0.9.9

- `OBDS-CORE` is no longer a separate normative document.
- `CORE Check Registry v1` is renamed `Foundation Check Registry v1`.
- every 1.0 manifest declares `obds-foundation`.
- existing Context Delivery, Design Space and Visual Operations concepts remain part of the single specification.

## Pre-release history

The sections below record the pre-release hardening cycles that led to 1.0.0. They are history. The released contract is OBDS 1.0.0 stable.

### RC3 integrity and decision hardening

- Brand States now describe knowledge only: `defined`, `unknown`, `not_defined`, `not_applicable`.
- prohibition has one Brand Truth path: an explicit RULE with `obligation: prohibit`.
- Context Assembly now starts from the validated Compiled Brand Context and cannot reconstruct normal target truth from the manifest.
- Compiled Brand Context carries target-scoped `elementRecords`, `availableElementIds` and its Context Assembly policy.
- Model Input Packages require a non-null `compiledContextHash`.
- Runtime Decision Record schema and reference runtime now agree on `assembly_failed`, `assemblyHash` and `modelInputHash`.
- Value Contracts now bind `valueContractRef`, `shapeHash`, `schemaRef`, `schemaHash` and optional `validatorRef`.
- `stance / semantic-boundary` standardises qualitative IS / IS NOT guidance without turning guidance into compliance.
- the release suite includes enum synchronisation tests and a Golden end-to-end pipeline test.

## Release safety

- canonical hashes prove approved bytes;
- shape hashes prove machine structure;
- schema hashes pin the semantic contract;
- validators prove additional deterministic invariants; and
- PATCH releases are limited to source-reference or annotation corrections and cannot change Brand Truth or runtime applicability.

Breaking contract changes after publication require OBDS 2.0.

### RC4 deterministic execution hardening

- added explicit Build Plan `asOf`; compiler selection no longer depends on wall-clock time;
- Compiled Brand Context now carries `build.asOf` and a runtime-enforced validity window;
- added an effective element `subject` key for machine-decidable precedence and conflict resolution; omitted `subject` defaults to the element ID;
- implemented scope-specific winner selection and hard conflicts for incomparable maximal elements of one subject;
- pinned OBDS Canonical Number v1 and added Python-to-JavaScript interoperability vectors;
- strict JSON and YAML loaders reject duplicate keys; YAML uses 1.2 boolean semantics; scope scalars are strings only;
- failed `require_approval` checks now withhold output and route to `approval_required`;
- invalid `phase` / `appliesTo` combinations fail validation;
- every defined RULES element requires a rule value contract regardless of nature;
- unsupported declared Brand Profiles fail closed;
- PATCH eligibility now rejects value, scope, state, validity, subject, classification, contract, addition and removal changes;
- measurement `min > max` fails;
- Composition conformance requires every `neverOmit` role in geometry evidence;
- aligned rule obligation vocabulary on `permit`;
- added root dependency declaration and removed platform metadata from release packaging;
- added 16 adversarial regression tests covering the RC3 review findings.

### RC5 final hardening

- unified Canonical JSON code across Foundation, Context Delivery and Context Assembly and added byte-drift tests;
- aligned canonical number serialisation with ECMAScript / RFC 8785 thresholds;
- pinned object-key ordering to UTF-16 code units and added non-BMP vectors;
- rejected wider integers that cannot round-trip through IEEE-754 binary64;
- made unsupported tokenizer declarations fail closed;
- internalised the legacy `colour-hex` fixture schema;
- compacted Reasoning Chapter rendering and model-facing HARD_BOUNDARIES;
- removed duplicated exact chapter blocks from the model input projection;
- retained explicit empty Rule fields in canonical Brand Truth because exact value-shape contracts make omission structurally significant; empty plumbing is removed only from the runtime model projection;
- added canonicalisation, tokenizer and payload regression tests.

## 1.0.0 stable promotion

The final pre-release contract was promoted to stable 1.0.0 after the complete release gate passed. No normative changes were made during promotion.
